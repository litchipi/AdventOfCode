# AdventOfCode
My attempts on [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), using these puzzles to practice langages I want to learn.

This is used as a journal report of my attempts, learnings and an archive of my codes so I can use them later in case of doubts, or nostalgy.

# December 2020 session
As I want to learn the Rust langage, I decided to use these puzzles to learn it
